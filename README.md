# Plane Seat Plan Website

Welcome Plane Seat Plan Website repository! This React application allows users to visualize and interact with the seating layout of a plane, similar to an online booking travel website.

## Demo

You can access the demo of this website from [HERE](https://plane-seatplan-yuanmarias-projects.vercel.app)

## Features

1. **Passenger Seats:**
   - Seats are displayed with three different colors based on the "occupied" flag:
     - Red: Indicates that the seat has been occupied by another passenger (`occupied = true`).
     - Yellow: Indicates that the seat is currently selected (`occupied = false`).
     - Green: Indicates that the seat is still available (`occupied = false`).
   - Clicking on a seat triggers different actions:
     - Red Seat: Opens a popup displaying information about the occupied seat.
     - Green Seat: Turns the seat yellow, displaying popup information about the seat (price, class, seat number), including an action button to book the seat.

2. **Exit Door:** 
   - Visual representation of the exit door.

3. **Aisle:**
   - Provides a clear path for people to pass by.
